The real-time chat application allows multiple users to send and receive messages. It was built using "React.js" for the frontend and "Node.js with Express" for the backend. "Socket.IO" is used to enable real-time communication between the server and clients. The backend (server.js) sets up the server and listens for messages from connected users. When a user sends a message, the server immediately sends it to everyone online. On the frontend (App.js), React creates the chat interface where users can type their names and messages. The Socket.IO client connects to the server, listens for incoming messages, and updates the chat window without needing to refresh the page. This setup ensures all users see messages instantly.
